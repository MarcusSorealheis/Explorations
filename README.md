# Explorations
I am going through Miguel's famous tutorial while exploring some other topics related to software development to help my fellow developers.

From commit #13 (my lucky number) onward, I will be trying to demonstrate a number of best practices and. 

1. how to commit atomically to reduce complexity for tasks like code review and rollback.
2. use some of the less frequently used `git` commands.
3. employ some best practices for storing information like application secrets in. (I'm reviewing myself because it's been a while).
4. learn which cloud infrastructure is best for which organization, based on size, technology involved, criticality of the systems managed. 
5. I don't have a fifth yet.
